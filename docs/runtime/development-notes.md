# 聊天与 Pi 运行能力开发说明

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev   # port 30142
```

Typecheck: `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`
Lint: `npm run lint`
**Never run `next build` during dev** — pollutes `.next/` and breaks `npm run dev`.

### Dev server troubleshooting

- Before starting a server, run `lsof -nP -iTCP:30142 -sTCP:LISTEN` and reuse the existing Pi Web process when it is healthy. A second `next dev` for the same checkout cannot use a different port as a workaround because both processes contend for `.next/dev/lock`.
- A browser-only `Module ... factory is not available` overlay usually means that tab has a stale Turbopack/HMR graph; it does not prove the server or source is broken. First call the browser's explicit reload action, then compare the current server log and a direct HTTP/API request.
- Restart only after the failure reproduces from a fresh page and the server-side checks also fail. Stop the exact dev process gracefully, move `.next` into a `mktemp -d` backup, and restart with the standard `npm run dev` command.
- Do not use `next dev --webpack` as a fallback. This repository's development graph can fail on `undici` imports such as `node:console`; development is expected to use Turbopack.
- Next.js maintains the generated `BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules` block at the end of this file. Keep the existing tracked block; inspect any runtime-generated change with `git status`.

**Session browsing** (read-only): reads `.jsonl` files through SDK `SessionManager` helpers and `src/server/sessions/session-reader.ts` — no AgentSession created.
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `src/server/agent/rpc-manager.ts` creates an AgentSession in-process.

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### AgentSession lifecycle (`src/server/agent/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__piSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes. Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__piStartLocks`)

### Fork must destroy the wrapper immediately
`AgentSession.fork()` **mutates the wrapper's inner state in-place** — after fork, `inner.sessionId` is the *new* session's id. If the wrapper stays alive in the registry under the old id, the next request gets the already-forked state and subsequent forks produce a corrupt `parentSession` chain.

**Fix**: `send("fork")` captures `newSessionId`, then calls `this.destroy()` before returning. The next request for the original session reloads a clean AgentSession from the original file.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** (Fork button on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** (Continue button / BranchNavigator): calls `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten
`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (pi does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### ToolCall field normalization
Pi stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `src/shared/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and `ChatWindow.handleAgentEvent()` (streaming).

### New session tool preset
Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` -> `toolNames[]`) and persisted in versioned `pi-web:tool-selection` custom entries. No entry means a legacy session and keeps Pi's default behavior; an empty array means Chat only. Chat only resolves before services are created, loads no extensions/skills/prompts/themes, and replaces Pi's base prompt with the ordered contents of Pi's discovered context files. Crossing the Chat-only boundary rebuilds the wrapper; changing between nonempty presets updates it in place. Subagents persist their active tools plus profile-level skill and extension loading switches in `resourceSnapshot`; loaded extensions cannot expose the reserved `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent` tools to a subagent. See `docs/runtime/adr/0002-chat-only-tool-selection.md`.

The last preset explicitly selected by the user is stored in browser `localStorage` and initializes fresh-session composers only. Existing sessions never trust that preference; they use their live `get_tools` state or pi's default when no wrapper exists.

### Pi 0.87 compatibility

The four Pi packages are pinned together at **0.87.1**. Next.js and its ESLint config are pinned at **16.3.5**; the unused image optimizer is disabled. Installing the global `pi-web` CLI does not update this application's dependencies.

- Exact prompts for Chat-only sessions and zero-tool subagents use the hidden inline extension in `src/server/agent/exact-system-prompt.ts`. Its `before_agent_start` handler resolves the prompt on every run, including after reload and session reopen. Never assign `agent.state.systemPrompt` or inject a legacy `context.systemPrompt` into the agent loop: Pi now derives it from the transcript. The wrapper's `get_state` returns the exact override for these sessions.
- Transcript `system` messages contain prompt sections and tool declarations. Keep their original IDs and parent relationships, but omit them from chat history, SSE, branch previews and Waygoal turn cards. They do not consume the history page budget.
- `usage` entries include billed cache warming in session totals. `context_edit` changes future model input through Pi's session manager while preserving the raw history shown to the user. Neither entry creates a canvas card or consumes the history page budget.
- Session-list timestamp ties follow Pi's file order (newest mtime, then reverse filename). The local scanner uses existing stat fingerprints for this ordering.
- Title generation and takeaway extraction still use a temporary `Agent`, which supplies normalized transcript context to the provider. Tests check the leading system message and ensure these requests leave the original conversation unchanged.

`src/server/agent/pi-compatibility.test.mjs` exercises the real SDK against a local fake model with isolated Pi data: prompt reload, reopening, fork boundaries, context edits, zero-tool child creation and resume. Browser coverage additionally checks shared-history forks and continuous chat navigation.

After `npm run build` in an isolated checkout, `E2E_SERVER_MODE=start npm run test:waygoal-branches` runs the continuous-chat suite against the production server; the default remains `dev`.

Adapted from [pi-web #931](https://github.com/agegr/pi-web/pull/931), with Waygoal-specific turn projection and history pagination handling. The SDK boundary changes are documented in [Pi's changelog](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/v0.87.1/packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md).

### Model defaults for new sessions
`GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` read from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. `ChatWindow` pre-selects this on mount for new sessions. Explicit browser model/thinking selections are applied atomically during AgentSession construction, then `src/server/agent/startup-preferences.ts` persists their effective values without replaying `set_model`/`set_thinking_level`; implicit `enabledModels` fallbacks and thinking pins are not persisted.

### `enabledModels` scoping
The `enabledModels` setting uses pi's `--models` syntax: minimatch globs against `provider/modelId` or a bare `modelId`, fuzzy matching for non-glob patterns, and an optional `:thinkingLevel` suffix. Never compare those patterns as literal strings — `src/server/models/model-scope.ts` delegates to the SDK's `resolveModelScopeWithDiagnostics()` so pi-web and the TUI agree on the visible model list, and falls back to all available models when patterns resolve to nothing. `startRpcSession()` resolves that scope before creating an AgentSession and passes the selected initial model, thinking pin, and SDK-native `scopedModels` atomically; `GET /api/models` reuses the helper only for selector data, `thinkingLevelPins`, and `modelScopeWarnings` display.

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream
On `ChatWindow` mount, `GET /api/agent/[id]` is called. If `state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel` and `isCompacting` are also synced from this response.

### Compaction SSE events
Newer pi emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older versions emitted `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. `handleAgentEvent` accepts both sets to keep `isCompacting` in sync. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns.

### Running state polling + reconciliation
- The sidebar polls `/api/agent/running` every 2.5 seconds while the tab is visible and pauses polling in background tabs. The session-list response remains the initial fallback.
- `useAgentSession` treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events and opens it before each prompt. `prompt_done` completes the current UI stage and notification immediately, but the idle SSE stays open for a 30-second grace window and is reused by the next prompt. `agent_start` cancels that close timer; `agent_settled` finishes extension-injected runs that have no wrapper-level `prompt_done` and starts a fresh grace window. Do not close on the first `agent_end`: retries, compaction, and extension-queued messages can continue the same logical prompt.
- While a run is active, `useAgentSession` periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed terminal events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `src/server/workspace/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.
- git prints POSIX-style absolute paths even on Windows, so every path read out of git goes through `toNativePath()` (`src/server/workspace/paths.ts`) before it is compared or returned. Compare paths with `samePath()`, never `===` — raw equality made `isTopLevel` permanently false on Windows and hid the worktree switcher entirely. Branch names are not paths and must keep their forward slashes. Browser code cannot apply Node path rules, so `/api/worktrees` resolves `currentWorktreePath` server-side; the sidebar must use that identity for highlighting and removal fallback.

### File access allow-list
- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/pi-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.
- Allowed roots are stored slash-normalized, but that is a Set-key convention, not a correctness requirement: `isPathWithinRoots()` (`src/server/workspace/path-security.ts`, the single implementation behind `isFilePathAllowed()`) re-resolves and case-folds both sides, so either path form authorizes correctly. Keep that one implementation — it is the security boundary.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` uses pi's `SettingsManager` + `DefaultPackageManager` for global/project package install, remove, update, enable, and disable. Disabling writes empty `extensions/skills/prompts/themes` arrays for that package entry.
- `/api/skills` uses `DefaultResourceLoader` so settings paths, package skills, and project `.agents/skills` are listed the same way the runtime sees them.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent pi`; project installs run with the selected cwd.

### Built-in subagents
- The global `builtInEnabled` switch is persisted in `~/.pi/agent/agents/settings.json` and defaults to `false` when the file or field is absent. Malformed settings fail closed; atomic updates preserve unknown fields.
- The inline built-in extension factory is always present so reloading an existing wrapper can apply setting changes, but it registers no tools while disabled. After changing the switch, the user must explicitly reload the current session.
- When enabled, only a recognized legacy `pi-subagents` extension that registers any reserved tool (`Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, or `steer_subagent`) is removed. Unrelated extensions remain loaded, and resolved conflict diagnostics are discarded.
- Runtime `Agent` dispatch checks the setting again so a stale tool call cannot start a subagent after the feature is switched off.
- See `docs/runtime/adr/0003-built-in-subagent-toggle.md` for the precedence and persistence rationale.

### Auth and model config
- `ModelsConfig` combines models from `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with provider auth status from pi's `AuthStorage`/`ModelRegistry`.
- Provider listing is capability-driven, never id-driven: `src/server/models/provider-listing.ts` decides membership from `auth.apiKey.login` / `auth.oauth` plus the stored credential type, so dual-auth providers (anthropic and github-copilot today — which providers declare both changes between SDK releases, so never assume it from an id) appear exactly once and never fall through both lists (#309). `src/server/models/provider-listing-runtime.ts` adapts `ModelRuntime` to those pure helpers.
- auth.json holds **one** credential per provider and `ModelRuntime.logout()` deletes whichever it is. The delete routes therefore use `removeStoredCredentialIfType()` to compare and delete under the same file lock used by pi's auth storage. `ModelsConfig` also refreshes *both* provider lists after any auth change — refreshing one leaves a dual-auth provider rendered twice.
- OAuth/device-code/manual-code flows are streamed by `GET /api/auth/login/[provider]`; manual code responses POST back with a short-lived token stored in `globalThis.__piLoginCallbacks`.
- API-key routes store and remove keys through `AuthStorage`. Status endpoints must never return the raw key.
- The model test route is `src/app/api/models-config/test/route.ts`; `app/api/models/test/` is not a real route.

### Completion sound
- `src/features/chat/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` as `pi-sound-enabled` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

### Exported session HTML
- `/api/sessions/[id]/export` delegates to pi's export helper, then patches recursive tree helpers in the generated HTML to iterative versions so very deep linear sessions do not overflow the browser call stack.

## Pi Session File Format

Location: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"zenmux","modelId":"claude-sonnet-4-6","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is a parallel array to `messages[]` — maps each displayed message back to its `.jsonl` entry id, used for fork and navigate_tree calls.
